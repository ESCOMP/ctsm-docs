NOTE: In order to help keep documentation up to date. There are README files in the CTSM
      checkout that are included in the User's Guide. In order to get these README files
      a checkout of CTSM needs to happen at the doc/source level as follows.

      cd doc/source
      git checkout -b release-clm5.0 https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm.git clm5.0

      When the User's Guide is built, it will then include these files as part of it.
      This means information in the README files (that have to be maintained) don't have
      to be repeated in the User's Guide, only in a different format.

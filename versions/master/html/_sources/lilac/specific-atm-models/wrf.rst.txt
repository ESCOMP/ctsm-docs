 Using CTSM with WRF
=====================

This section describes the procedure for building and running the CTSM
library and its dependencies, and linking to these libraries in the WRF
model's build via LILAC. As such this section repeats some information
from earlier sections but in recipe form and with minimal detail.

.. important::

  This section assumes use of a machine that has been ported to CIME.
  In this example we assume NCARâ€™s cheyenne computer in particular.

Clone CTSM Repository
-------------------------

Decide where you will work, for example::

    mkdir git_wrf_ctsm
    cd git_wrf_ctsm


Clone CTSM repository and checkout lilac_cap branch::

    git clone https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm.git
    cd ctsm
    git checkout lilac_cap
    ./manage_externals/checkout_externals

Build CTSM and its dependencies based on instructions from previous sections,
for example for cheyenne::

    ./lilac/build_ctsm /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir --compiler intel --machine cheyenne


Set environment similar to environments used for your CTSM build using
ctsm_build_environment.sh for bash::

    source /ctsm_build_dir/ctsm_build_environment.sh

or ctsm_build_environment.csh for Cshell:

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    source /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/ctsm_build_environment.csh

.. note::

  For additional details on preparing the CTSM, including how to
  recompile when making code changes to the CTSM, read section
  _obtaining-and-building-ctsm. <-- CREATED LINK TO THE CORRECT SECTION?

Building the WRF model with CTSM
--------------------------------

.. todo::

    update the git address to WRF feature branch...

Clone WRF CTSM branch into your directory::

    git clone git@github.com:billsacks/WRF.git
    cd WRF
    git checkout lilac_dev


For building WRF using CTSM, we should set makefile variables from CTSM needed for
WRF build by (BASH)::

    export WRF_CTSM_MKFILE=/glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/bld/ctsm.mk

or (Cshell):

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    setenv WRF_CTSM_MKFILE /glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/bld/ctsm.mk

.. todo::

    Bill and Sam do we need the following still:?

The following is needed in order to undo an undesired setting in that env_mach_specific file::

  export MPI_USE_ARRAY=None

or (Cshell):

.. code-block:: Tcsh

  setenv MPI_USE_ARRAY None

There are also few other environmental setting that should be set for building WRF.
Some of these are not required, but might help if you face any compilation errors.

Explicitly define which model core to build by::

    export WRF_EM_CORE=1

or (Cshell):

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    setenv WRF_EM_CORE 1

Explicilty turn off data assimilation by::

    export WRF_DA_CORE=0

or (Cshell):

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    setenv WRF_DA_CORE 0


Make sure you set NETCDF environment variable by::

    setenv NETCDF /usr/local/netcdf/ (or wherever you have netcdf compiled.)

Then configure and build WRF for your machine and intended compiler by::

    ./clean -a
    ./configure

Choose one of the options, similar to the compiler used for building CTSM.

Next, choose one of the options for nesting. Currently nesting is not available for WRF-CTSM,
therefore we should use 1.

Then compile em_real and save the log::

    ./compile em_real >& compile.log


.. note::

    The ./compile step might take more than 30 minutes to complete.


.. note::

    Check the bottom of your log file for a successful compilation message
    or search the file for the string "Error" with a capital E.

.. note::

    Optional: One may use tmux or nohup for configuring and compiling.
    Try "man nohup" for more information.



Compile WRF Preprocessing System (WPS)
--------------------------------------

The WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) is a set of programs to prepare
input to the real program for WRF real-data simulations.

.. note::

    Building WPS requires that WRF be already built successfully.


Get WPS zipped tar file from:

http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_source.html

Untar WPS tar file::

    gzip -cd WPSV4.0.TAR.gz | tar -xf -


Then compile WPS similar to the way WRF was built. In summary::

    cd WPS
    ./configure

Here choose one option, for your intended compiler, similar to your WRF build.
After configuring, you can check configure.wps for making sure all the libs and paths 
are set correctly.

Then, compile WPS::

    ./compile >& compile.log

.. note::

    If wps build is succsfully you should see geogrid.exe, ungrib.exe, and metgrid.exe.
    Alternatively, you can check the log for successful build message.


Run WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) Steps
-----------------------------------------

Edit namelist.wps for your domain of interest, which should be the same
domain as used in your WRF namelist.

First, use geogrid.exe to define the domain and interpolate static geographical data
to the grids::

    ./geogrid.exe >& log.geogrid

If the geogrid step is finished successfully, you should see the following message in
the log file::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of geogrid.   !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Check the geogrid log file for successful ******
Link the GRIB data files that are going to be used::

    ./link_grib.csh $your_GRIB_data_path

Extract meteorological fields from GRIB-formatted files::

    ./ungrib.exe >& log.ungrib

Check ungrib log for the following message showing successful completion of ungrib step::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of ungrib.   !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!






Horizontally interpolate the meteorological fields extracted by ungrib to
the model grids defined in geogrid::

    ./metgrid.exe >& log.metgrid



Check the metgrid log for the following message showing successful completion of
metgrid step::

    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !  Successful completion of metgrid.  !
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



Run real program
----------------
Run real.exe to generate initial and boundary conditions. 

Follow WRF instructions for creating initial and boundary
conditions. In summary, complete the following steps: 

Move or link WPS output files (met_em.d01* files) to your WRF/run directory. 

Edit namelist.input for your WRF domain and desirable configurations.
This should be the same domain as in the namelist used in WPS.


To run WRF-CTSM, change land-surface option to 51::

  sf_surface_physics = 51

.. note::

  sf_surface_physics values for running WRF-Noah and WRF-NoahMP are
  2 and 4, respectively.

.. todo::

    add the link and adding some note that nested run is not possible....

Run real.exe (if compiled parallel submit a batch job) to generate
wrfinput and wrfbdy files.


Check the last line of the real log file for the following message::

    SUCCESS COMPLETE REAL_EM INIT

Create input namelists for CTSM and LILAC
=========================================

Introduce the following diffs to ./git_wrf_ctsm/ctsm/lilac/atm_driver/<file>
by replacing the entries preceded by minus signs with the entries
preceded by plus signs.

diff ./lilac/atm_driver/atm_driver_in ./lilac/atm_driver/atm_driver_in:

.. code-block:: diff

  -  atm_mesh_file = '/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/share/meshes/fv4x5_050615_polemod_ESMFmesh.nc'

diff ./lilac/atm_driver/lilac_in ./lilac/atm_driver/lilac_in:

  - atm_mesh_filename = '/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/share/meshes/fv4x5_050615_polemod_ESMFmesh.nc'

  + lnd_mesh_filename = '/glade/work/slevis/barlage_wrf_ctsm/conus/mesh/wrf2ctsm_land_conus_ESMFMesh_c20191216.nc'

Before you generate the lnd_in file, you may modify user_nl_clm in
/glade/scratch/$USER/ctsm_build_dir/case/. For example you may wish to
point to an alternate CTSM initial condition file. To merge WRF initial
conditions from a wrfinput file into a CTSM initial condition file, type::

 module load ncl/6.6.2
 ncl transfer_wrfinput_to_ctsm_with_snow.ncl 'finidat="finidat_interp_dest.nc"' 'wrfinput="./git_wrf_ctsm/WRF/test/em_real/wrfinput_d01.noseaice"' 'merged="finidat_interp_dest_wrfinit_snow.nc"'

.. todo::

 Need to make the above ncl script available. I assume that the finidat
 and the wrfinput files need to be consistent for this to work. If so,
 we should prob. explain how to generate a consistent finidat file.

Generate the lnd_in file by running the following from
./git_wrf_ctsm/ctsm/lilac/atm_driver::

  ../../lilac_config/buildnml 

Copy lilac_in, lnd_in, and lnd_modelio.nml to the WRF/run directory.




Run WRF
-------

If real program is completed successfully, we should see wrfinput and wrfbdy files
in our directory.

Next, we should run WRF.

For Cheyenne, we should submit a batch job to PBS (Pro workload management system).
For more instructions on running a batch job on Cheyenne, please check:
https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne/running-jobs/submitting-jobs-pbs


A sample of basic PBS job for Cheyenne:

.. code-block:: Tcsh

    #!/bin/tcsh
    #PBS -N job_name
    #PBS -A project_code
    #PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
    #PBS -q queue_name
    #PBS -j oe
    #PBS -k eod
    #PBS -m abe
    #PBS -M your_email_address
    #PBS -l select=2:ncpus=36:mpiprocs=36

    ### Set TMPDIR as recommended
    setenv TMPDIR /glade/scratch/$USER/temp
    mkdir -p $TMPDIR

    ### Run the executable
    mpiexec_mpt ./wrf.exe

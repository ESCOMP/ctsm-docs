<p>The purpose of this technical note is to describe the biogeophysical and
biogeochemical parameterizations and numerical implementation of version
4.5 of the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). Scientific justification and
evaluation of these parameterizations can be found in the referenced
scientific papers (Chapter 27). This technical note and the CLM4.5
User’s Guide together provide the user with the scientific description
and operating instructions for CLM.</p>

<h3>1.1.1. Inception of CLM<a class="headerlink" href="#inception-of-clm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The early development of the Community Land Model can be described as
the merging of a community-developed land model focusing on
biogeophysics and a concurrent effort at NCAR to expand the NCAR Land
Surface Model (NCAR LSM, Bonan 1996) to include the carbon cycle,
vegetation dynamics, and river routing. The concept of a
community-developed land component of the Community Climate System Model
(CCSM) was initially proposed at the CCSM Land Model Working Group
(LMWG) meeting in February 1996. Initial software specifications and
development focused on evaluating the best features of three existing
land models: the NCAR LSM (Bonan 1996, 1998) used in the Community
Climate Model (CCM3) and the initial version of CCSM; the Institute of
Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences land model (IAP94) (Dai
and Zeng 1997); and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS)
(Dickinson et al. 1993) used with CCM2. A scientific steering committee
was formed to review the initial specifications of the design provided
by Robert Dickinson, Gordon Bonan, Xubin Zeng, and Yongjiu Dai and to
facilitate further development. Steering committee members were selected
so as to provide guidance and expertise in disciplines not generally
well-represented in land surface models (e.g., carbon cycling,
ecological modeling, hydrology, and river routing) and included
scientists from NCAR, the university community, and government
laboratories (R. Dickinson, G. Bonan, X. Zeng, Paul Dirmeyer, Jay
Famiglietti, Jon Foley, and Paul Houser).</p>
<p>The specifications for the new model, designated the Common Land Model,
were discussed and agreed upon at the June 1998 CCSM Workshop LMWG
meeting. An initial code was developed by Y. Dai and was examined in
March 1999 by Mike Bosilovich, P. Dirmeyer, and P. Houser. At this point
an extensive period of code testing was initiated. Keith Oleson, Y. Dai,
Adam Schlosser, and P. Houser presented preliminary results of offline
1-dimensional testing at the June 1999 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting.
Results from more extensive offline testing at plot, catchment, and
large scale (up to global) were presented by Y. Dai, A. Schlosser, K.
Oleson, M. Bosilovich, Zong-Liang Yang, Ian Baker, P. Houser, and P.
Dirmeyer at the LMWG meeting hosted by COLA (Center for
Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies) in November 1999. Field data used for
validation included sites adopted by the Project for Intercomparison of
Land-surface Parameterization Schemes (Henderson-Sellers et al. 1993)
(Cabauw, Valdai, Red-Arkansas river basin) and others [FIFE (Sellers et
al. 1988), BOREAS (Sellers et al. 1995), HAPEX-MOBILHY (André et al.
1986), ABRACOS (Gash et al. 1996), Sonoran Desert (Unland et al. 1996),
GSWP (Dirmeyer et al. 1999)]. Y. Dai also presented results from a
preliminary coupling of the Common Land Model to CCM3, indicating that
the land model could be successfully coupled to a climate model.</p>
<p>Results of coupled simulations using CCM3 and the Common Land Model were
presented by X. Zeng at the June 2000 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting.
Comparisons with the NCAR LSM and observations indicated major
improvements to the seasonality of runoff, substantial reduction of a
summer cold bias, and snow depth. Some deficiencies related to runoff
and albedo were noted, however, that were subsequently addressed. Z.-L.
Yang and I. Baker demonstrated improvements in the simulation of snow
and soil temperatures. Sam Levis reported on efforts to incorporate a
river routing model to deliver runoff to the ocean model in CCSM. Soon
after the workshop, the code was delivered to NCAR for implementation
into the CCSM framework. Documentation for the Common Land Model is
provided by Dai et al. (2001) while the coupling with CCM3 is described
in Zeng et al. (2002). The model was introduced to the modeling
community in Dai et al. (2003).</p>

<h3>1.1.2. CLM2<a class="headerlink" href="#clm2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Concurrent with the development of the Common Land Model, the NCAR LSM
was undergoing further development at NCAR in the areas of carbon
cycling, vegetation dynamics, and river routing. The preservation of
these advancements necessitated several modifications to the Common Land
Model. The biome-type land cover classification scheme was replaced with
a plant functional type (PFT) representation with the specification of
PFTs and leaf area index from satellite data (Oleson and Bonan 2000;
Bonan et al. 2002a, b). This also required modifications to
parameterizations for vegetation albedo and vertical burying of
vegetation by snow. Changes were made to canopy scaling, leaf
physiology, and soil water limitations on photosynthesis to resolve
deficiencies indicated by the coupling to a dynamic vegetation model.
Vertical heterogeneity in soil texture was implemented to improve
coupling with a dust emission model. A river routing model was
incorporated to improve the fresh water balance over oceans. Numerous
modest changes were made to the parameterizations to conform to the
strict energy and water balance requirements of CCSM. Further
substantial software development was also required to meet coding
standards. The resulting model was adopted in May 2002 as the Community
Land Model (CLM2) for use with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2, the
successor to CCM3) and version 2 of the Community Climate System Model
(CCSM2).</p>
<p>K. Oleson reported on initial results from a coupling of CCM3 with CLM2
at the June 2001 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting. Generally, the CLM2
preserved most of the improvements seen in the Common Land Model,
particularly with respect to surface air temperature, runoff, and snow.
These simulations are documented in Bonan et al. (2002a). Further small
improvements to the biogeophysical parameterizations, ongoing software
development, and extensive analysis and validation within CAM2 and CCSM2
culminated in the release of CLM2 to the community in May 2002.</p>
<p>Following this release, Peter Thornton implemented changes to the model
structure required to represent carbon and nitrogen cycling in the
model. This involved changing data structures from a single vector of
spatially independent sub-grid patches to one that recognizes three
hierarchical scales within a model grid cell: land unit, snow/soil
column, and PFT. Furthermore, as an option, the model can be configured
so that PFTs can share a single soil column and thus “compete” for
water. This version of the model (CLM2.1) was released to the community
in February 2003. CLM2.1, without the compete option turned on, produced
only round off level changes when compared to CLM2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clm3">
<h3>1.1.3. CLM3<a class="headerlink" href="#clm3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CLM3 implemented further software improvements related to performance
and model output, a re-writing of the code to support vector-based
computational platforms, and improvements in biogeophysical
parameterizations to correct deficiencies in the coupled model climate.
Of these parameterization improvements, two were shown to have a
noticeable impact on simulated climate. A variable aerodynamic
resistance for heat/moisture transfer from ground to canopy air that
depends on canopy density was implemented. This reduced unrealistically
high surface temperatures in semi-arid regions. The second improvement
added stability corrections to the diagnostic 2-m air temperature
calculation which reduced biases in this temperature. Competition
between PFTs for water, in which PFTs share a single soil column, is the
default mode of operation in this model version. CLM3 was released to
the community in June 2004. Dickinson et al. (2006) describe the climate
statistics of CLM3 when coupled to CCSM3.0. Hack et al. (2006) provide
an analysis of selected features of the land hydrological cycle.
Lawrence et al. (2007) examine the impact of changes in CLM3
hydrological parameterizations on partitioning of evapotranspiration
(ET) and its effect on the timescales of ET response to precipitation
events, interseasonal soil moisture storage, soil moisture memory, and
land-atmosphere coupling. Qian et al. (2006) evaluate CLM3’s performance
in simulating soil moisture content, runoff, and river discharge when
forced by observed precipitation, temperature and other atmospheric
data.</p>

<h3>1.1.4. CLM3.5<a class="headerlink" href="#clm3-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although the simulation of land surface climate by CLM3 was in many ways
adequate, most of the unsatisfactory aspects of the simulated climate
noted by the above studies could be traced directly to deficiencies in
simulation of the hydrological cycle. In 2004, a project was initiated
to improve the hydrology in CLM3 as part of the development of CLM
version 3.5. A selected set of promising approaches to alleviating the
hydrologic biases in CLM3 were tested and implemented. These included
new surface datasets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, new parameterizations for canopy
integration, canopy interception, frozen soil, soil water availability,
and soil evaporation, a TOPMODEL-based model for surface and subsurface
runoff, a groundwater model for determining water table depth, and the
introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen limitation on plant
productivity. Oleson et al. (2008a) show that CLM3.5 exhibits
significant improvements over CLM3 in its partitioning of global ET
which result in wetter soils, less plant water stress, increased
transpiration and photosynthesis, and an improved annual cycle of total
water storage. Phase and amplitude of the runoff annual cycle is
generally improved. Dramatic improvements in vegetation biogeography
result when CLM3.5 is coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model.
Stöckli et al. (2008) examine the performance of CLM3.5 at local scales
by making use of a network of long-term ground-based ecosystem
observations [FLUXNET (Baldocchi et al. 2001)]. Data from 15 FLUXNET
sites were used to demonstrate significantly improved soil hydrology and
energy partitioning in CLM3.5. CLM3.5 was released to the community in
May, 2007.</p>

<h3>1.1.5. CLM4<a class="headerlink" href="#clm4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for the next version of the model, CLM4, was to
incorporate several recent scientific advances in the understanding and
representation of land surface processes, expand model capabilities, and
improve surface and atmospheric forcing datasets (Lawrence et al. 2011).
Included in the first category are more sophisticated representations of
soil hydrology and snow processes. In particular, new treatments of soil
column-groundwater interactions, soil evaporation, aerodynamic
parameters for sparse/dense canopies, vertical burial of vegetation by
snow, snow cover fraction and aging, black carbon and dust deposition,
and vertical distribution of solar energy for snow were implemented.
Major new capabilities in the model include a representation of the
carbon-nitrogen cycle (CLM4CN, see next paragraph for additional
information), the ability to model land cover change in a transient
mode, inclusion of organic soil and deep soil into the existing mineral
soil treatment to enable more realistic modeling of permafrost, an urban
canyon model to contrast rural and urban energy balance and climate
(CLMU), and an updated biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) model.
Other modifications of note include refinement of the global PFT,
wetland, and lake distributions, more realistic optical properties for
grasslands and croplands, and an improved diurnal cycle and spectral
distribution of incoming solar radiation to force the model in offline
mode.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas incorporated into the carbon and nitrogen cycle
component of CLM4 derive from the earlier development of the offline
ecosystem process model Biome-BGC (Biome BioGeochemical Cycles),
originating at the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) at the
University of Montana, under the guidance of Prof. Steven Running.
Biome-BGC itself is an extension of an earlier model, Forest-BGC
<strong>(Running and Coughlan, 1988; Running and Gower, 1991)</strong>, which
simulates water, carbon, and, to a limited extent, nitrogen fluxes for
forest ecosystems. Forest-BGC was designed to be driven by remote
sensing inputs of vegetation structure, and so used a diagnostic
(prescribed) leaf area index, or, in the case of the dynamic allocation
version of the model <strong>(Running and Gower, 1991)</strong>, prescribed maximum
leaf area index.</p>
<p>Biome-BGC expanded on the Forest-BGC logic by introducing a more
mechanistic calculation of leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis <strong>(Hunt
and Running, 1992)</strong>, and extending the physiological parameterizations
to include multiple woody and non-woody vegetation types <strong>(Hunt et al.
1996; Running and Hunt, 1993)</strong>. Later versions of Biome-BGC introduced
more mechanistic descriptions of belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles,
nitrogen controls on photosynthesis and decomposition, sunlit and shaded
canopies, vertical gradient in leaf morphology, and explicit treatment
of fire and harvest disturbance and regrowth dynamics <strong>(Kimball et al.
1997; Thornton, 1998; Thornton et al. 2002; White et al. 2000)</strong>.
Biome-BGC version 4.1.2 <strong>(Thornton et al. 2002)</strong> provided a point of
departure for integrating new biogeochemistry components into CLM4.</p>
<p>CLM4 was released to the community in June, 2010 along with the
Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). CLM4 is used in CCSM4,
CESM1, CESM1.1, and remains available as the default land component
model option for coupled simulations in CESM1.2.</p>

<h3>1.1.6. CLM4.5<a class="headerlink" href="#clm4-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The motivations for the development of CLM4.5 (the model version
described in this Technical Description) were similar to those for CLM4:
incorporate several recent scientific advances in the understanding and
representation of land surface processes, expand model capabilities, and
improve surface and atmospheric forcing datasets.</p>
<p>Specifically, several parameterizations were revised to reflect new
scientific understanding and in an attempt to reduce biases identified
in CLM4 simulations including low soil carbon stocks especially in the
Arctic, excessive tropical GPP and unrealistically low Arctic GPP, a dry
soil bias in Arctic soils, unrealistically high LAI in the tropics, a
transient 20<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/99dc7dfb3073bface29bdc5259fc663a005c9c02.png" alt="{}^{th}"/> century carbon response that was
inconsistent with observational estimates, and several other more minor
problems or biases.</p>
<p>The main modifications include updates to canopy processes including a
revised canopy radiation scheme and canopy scaling of leaf processes,
co-limitations on photosynthesis, revisions to photosynthetic parameters
(Bonan et al. 2011),</p>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">had three stars here - need to resolve this</p>
</div>
<p>temperature acclimation of photosynthesis, and
improved stability of the iterative solution in the photosynthesis and
stomatal conductance model (Sun et al. 2012). Hydrology updates include
modifications such that hydraulic properties of frozen soils are
determined by liquid water content only rather than total water content
and the introduction of an ice impedance function, and other corrections
that increase the consistency between soil water state and water table
position and allow for a perched water table above icy permafrost ground
(Swenson et al. 2012). A new snow cover fraction parameterization is
incorporated that reflects the hysteresis in fractional snow cover for a
given snow depth between accumulation and melt phases (Swenson and
Lawrence, 2012). The lake model in CLM4 is replaced with a completely
revised and more realistic lake model (Subin et al. 2012a). A surface
water store is introduced, replacing the wetland land unit and
permitting prognostic wetland distribution modeling, and the surface
energy fluxes are calculated separately (Swenson and Lawrence, 2012) for
snow-covered, water-covered, and snow/water-free portions of vegetated
and crop land units, and snow-covered and snow-free portions of glacier
land units. Globally constant river flow velocity is replaced with
variable flow velocity based on mean grid cell slope. A vertically
resolved soil biogeochemistry scheme is introduced with base
decomposition rates modified by soil temperature, water, and oxygen
limitations and also including vertical mixing of soil carbon and
nitrogen due to bioturbation, cryoturbation, and diffusion (Koven et al.
2013). The litter and soil carbon and nitrogen pool structure as well as
nitrification and denitrification are modified based on the Century
model and biological fixation is revised to distribute fixation more
realistically over the year (Koven et al. 2013). The fire model is
replaced with a model that includes representations of natural and
anthropogenic triggers and suppression as well as agricultural,
deforestation, and peat fires (Li et al. 2012a,b; Li et al. 2013a). The
biogenic volatile organic compounds model is updated to MEGAN2.1
(Guenther et al. 2012).</p>
<p>Additions to the model include a methane production, oxidation, and
emissions model (Riley et al. 2011a) and an extension of the crop model
to include interactive fertilization, organ pools (Drewniak et al.
2013), and irrigation (Sacks et al. 2009). Elements of the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model are included as an alternative
optional runoff generation scheme (Li et al. 2011). There is also an
option to run with a multilayer canopy (Bonan et al. 2012). Multiple
urban density classes, rather than the single dominant urban density
class used in CLM4, are modeled in the urban land unit. Carbon
(<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/f1111e80bbbe5fc59c06cf124039476c8e35e237.png" alt="{}^{13}"/>C and <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/e8208e06f924e8b3a2805d784b4910198deaf24f.png" alt="{}^{14}"/>C) isotopes are enabled (Koven
et al. 2013). Minor changes include a switch of the C3 Arctic grass and
shrub phenology from stress deciduous to seasonal deciduous and a change
in the glacier bare ice albedo to better reflect recent estimates.
Finally, the carbon and nitrogen cycle spinup is accelerated and
streamlined with a revised spinup method, though the spinup timescale
remains long.</p>
<p>Finally, the predominantly low resolution input data for provided with
CLM4 to create CLM4 surface datasets is replaced with newer and higher
resolution input datasets where possible (see section 2.2.3 for
details). The default meteorological forcing dataset provided with CLM4
(Qian et al. 2006) is replaced with the 1901-2010 CRUNCEP forcing
dataset (see Chapter 26) for CLM4.5, though users can also still use the
Qian et al. (2006) dataset or other alternative forcing datasets.</p>
<p>CLM4.5 was released to the community in June 2013 along with the
Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1.2).</p>

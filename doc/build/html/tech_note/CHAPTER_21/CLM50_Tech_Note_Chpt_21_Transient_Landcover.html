<p>CLM includes a treatment of mass and energy fluxes associated with
prescribed temporal change in land cover. Using an annual time series of
the spatial distribution of PFTs and wood harvest, CLM diagnoses the
change in area for PFTs at each model time step and then performs mass
and energy balance accounting necessary to represent the expansion and
contraction of PFT area. This implementation currently only pertains to
the case where all PFTs for a particular grid cell coexist on a single
soil/snow column. In this case, the only biogeophysical state variable
affected is canopy water (<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/258eda6779920de57a66eb543a1f37e4f20e2f5b.png" alt="W_{can}"/> ). The biogeochemical impacts
of land use and land cover change are simulated through changes in CLM
carbon pools and fluxes as shown in Figure 21.1 and described further in
Chapter 13. Other implementations are possible, such as changing the
area of soil/snow columns or land unit area, however these require
additional consideration of conservation of mass and energy among the
soil/snow columns and land units which will be implemented in future
versions of CLM.</p>

<h2>21.1. Annual Transient Land Cover Data and Time Interpolation<a class="headerlink" href="#annual-transient-land-cover-data-and-time-interpolation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The changes in area over time associated with individual PFTs are
prescribed through a forcing dataset, referred to here as the <em>dynpft</em>
dataset. The <em>dynpft</em> dataset consists of an annual time series of
global grids, where each annual time slice describes the fractional area
occupied by all PFTs and the annual wood harvest within each grid cell.
Changes in area and wood harvest for each PFT within a grid cell at each
model time step are inferred from a time-interpolation of the area
information for the PFT from the two bracketing annual time slices in
the <em>dynpft</em> dataset.</p>
<p>As a special case, when the time dimension of the <em>dynpft</em> dataset
starts at a later year than the current model time step, the first time
slice from the <em>dynpft</em> dataset is used to represent the current time
step PFT fractional area distributions. Similarly, when the time
dimension of the <em>dynpft</em> dataset stops at an earlier year than the
current model time step, the last time slice of the <em>dynpft</em> dataset is
used. Thus, the simulation will have invariant representations of PFT
distributions through time for the periods prior to and following the
time duration of the <em>dynpft</em> dataset, with transient PFT distributions
during the period covered by the <em>dynpft</em> dataset.</p>
<p>The following equations capture this logic, where <img class="math" src="../../_images/math/90254843cacffcbe34b3b12526cdf4718b7e7c30.png" alt="year_{cur}"/>  is

<p>This section describes the development of the d<em>ynpft</em> dataset.
Development of this dataset requires adapting for use with the CLM a

<p>To coordinate the processing and consistency of land use and land cover
change data between the historical period (1850-2005) and the four IPCC
representative concentration pathways (RCPs) derived from integrated
assessment models (IAM), the University of New Hampshire
(stocktickerUNH) research group (Louise Chini, George Hurtt, Steve
Frolking; luh.unh.edu) produced a harmonized transient dataset for use
in climate change simulations. The historical component of the transient
land use and land cover change dataset is Version 1 of the Land-Use
History A product (LUHa.v1) covering the period 1850-2005. The RCP
transient land use and land cover change components (2005-2100) are
referred to as the Future Land-Use Harmonization A products. Version 1
(LUHa.v1_future.v1) is used for the AIM, MESSAGE, and MiniCAM IAMs;
Version 1.1 (LUHa.v1_future.v1.1) is used for the IMAGE IAM. The land
cover information is provided at 0.5 degree grid resolution and includes
fractional grid cell coverage by crops, pasture, and primary and
secondary natural vegetation.</p>
<p>The crop fraction of the grid cell represents the area of the grid cell
used to grow any type of crop. Similarly, pasture represents the
fraction of a grid cell used for grazing livestock. The remaining area
in a half degree grid cell is partitioned into primary and secondary
vegetation. Primary vegetation represents the fractional area of a grid
cell with vegetation undisturbed by human activities. Secondary
vegetation represents vegetated areas that have recovered from some
human disturbance; this could include re-vegetation of pasture and crop
areas as well as primary vegetation areas that have been logged.</p>
<p>The stocktickerUNH dataset provides a transition matrix that describes
the annual fraction of land that is transformed from one category to
another (e.g. primary land to crop, pasture to crop, etc.; Hurtt et al.
2006). Included in these transitions is the conversion of secondary land
to secondary land, representing the logging on land recovering from an
earlier disturbance. These transitions provide information on all
changes in land cover through the sum of all transitions in a given
year. Harmonized prescriptions of CMIP5 wood harvest statistics also are
provided by (Hurtt et al. 2011) for the historical and RCP time series.
The wood harvest is prescribed spatially on the same 0.5 degree grid as
the land use class transitions for each year.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency with the various land use classes wood harvest is
prescribed as both the area of land harvested and the amount of carbon
extracted in the grid cell for a particular year. To account for the
differences in standing amount of wood carbon as well as the differences
in harvest intensity associated with the different land units, the
harvest area and carbon amounts are prescribed for the five classes of:
PlaceNamePrimary PlaceTypeForest, PlaceNamePrimary PlaceTypeNon-Forest,
PlaceNameSecondary PlaceNameMature PlaceTypeForest, PlaceNameSecondary
PlaceNameYoung PlaceTypeForest, and PlaceNameplaceSecondary
PlaceTypeNon-Forest.</p>

<h3>21.3.2. 21.3.2 Representing Land Use and Land Cover Change in CLM<a class="headerlink" href="#representing-land-use-and-land-cover-change-in-clm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CLM represents the land surface as a hierarchy of sub-grid types:
glacier; lake; wetland; urban; and vegetated land. The vegetated land is
further divided into a mosaic of PFTs. To represent the UNH transient
land use and land cover change dataset in CLM, the annual fractional
composition of crop, pasture, primary vegetation, and secondary
vegetation land units specified in the UNH dataset needs to be
faithfully represented with a corresponding PFT mosaic in CLM using the
methods described in Lawrence et al (2012). This method translated each
of the UNH land units into fractional PFT values based on current day
and potential vegetation CLM land surface parameters for that grid cell
and for that year, as shown in Figure 21.2.</p>
<p>The methodology for creating the transient PFT dataset is based on four
steps which are applied across the time series. First, crop PFT
composition is directly specified from the crop land unit fractional
area. Second, pasture PFTs are assigned based on grass PFTs found in the
potential vegetation and current day CLM land surface parameters scaled
by the area of pasture. Third, potential vegetation PFTs are assigned to
the grid cell scaled by the fractional area of the primary land unit.
Last, current day non-crop and non-pasture PFTs are assigned to the grid
cell scaled by the fractional area of the secondary land unit. The
annual tree harvest values also are calculated from the harvest
information of the UNH dataset used in conjunction with transient tree
PFT values. Separate datasets representing the extent of water, wetland,
ice and urban land cover are used to compile the final land cover
present in each CLM grid cell. These additional non-vegetated land cover
fractions are held constant throughout the time series. All datasets are
resolved at the half degree grid resolution.</p>

<h3>21.3.3. 21.3.3 Present Day PFT Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#present-day-pft-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The present day dataset is based on the methodology of Lawrence and
Chase (2007) and uses a variety of satellite products to develop present
day PFT distributions with matching leaf area index values. The dataset
initially derives fractions of bare ground and tree cover from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation
continuous fields product (Hansen et al. 2003). To further distinguish
tree types, the tree fraction is divided into broadleaf/needleleaf and
evergreen/deciduous types based on the Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR) continuous fields tree cover (DeFries et al. 2000).
The remaining grid cell area is assumed to be herbaceous grasses and
shrubs, including crops. The area of crop is initially determined from
Ramankutty et al. (2008) circa 2000 global crop land areas, and the
remaining grass and shrub fractions are derived from the MODIS land
cover (Friedl et al. 2002). Further subdivisions of grass, shrub and
tree PFTs into tropical, temperate and boreal types were based on the
physiology and climate rules from Nemani and Running (1996), and for
C3/C4 photosynthetic pathways based on MODIS derived leaf area index
values and the mapping methods of Still et al. (2003). In contrast to
Lawrence and Chase (2007), the understory grasses of forested areas have
been replaced with trees for the dataset. Some advantages of this
dataset are that it reproduces the physical properties as observed by
the MODIS land surface data (e.g. grid cell albedo and leaf area index
values) while maintaining the multiple PFT representation.</p>

<h3>21.3.4. 21.3.4 Potential PFT Distribution<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-pft-distribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Essential to any reconstruction of past vegetation distributions is the
need to know the potential vegetation that would be there prior to human
activities. Many researchers have worked to estimate potential
vegetation types at regional and global scales from remnant vegetation
and other field data or from bioclimatic models. The CLM potential PFT
distribution is derived from Ramankutty et al. (2008) at 5 arc-minute
resolution. However, this product is based on a biome type
classification system that is not directly compatible with the CLM PFT
distributions.</p>
<p>The CLM potential vegetation is described by Lawrence and Chase (2010).
This reconstruction describes potential PFT distributions extrapolated
from the current day PFT composition of remnant natural biomes as mapped
by Ramankutty et al. (2008). The current day remnant natural PFT
parameters were taken from the Lawrence and Chase (2007) dataset with
the same forest understory changes as described above to ensure
consistency between the two datasets. The current day remnant natural
PFT biome compositions were spatially extrapolated to the potential
vegetation biome distributions provided by Ramankutty et al. (2008)
using inverse distance weighted methods. The resulting product is a CLM
PFT distribution that may have existed prior to human disturbance under
current day climate conditions.</p>

<h3>21.3.5. 21.3.5 Transient Land Cover Change Dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#transient-land-cover-change-dataset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For each year from 1850 to 2005 and to 2100 for each of the four RCPs,
PFT distributions and wood harvest are adjusted based on the
stocktickerUNH dataset. Initially the grid cell is checked to adjust the
crop area based on the stocktickerUNH crop area. If the crop area
exceeds the available land area (i.e. the grid cell area minus the area
assigned to glacier, wetlands, lake and urban areas) then all the
available area is allocated to crops and no other PFTs are added. After
the crop area is assigned, any remaining area is considered available
for pasture.</p>
<p>As the pasture data from the stocktickerUNH dataset represents grazing,
pasture areas are assigned in the present day based on the availability
of grasses (C3, C4 and boreal C3 PFTs) and shrubs relative to the bare
soil fraction. If the grazing area exceeds the total vegetated area from
both the potential and current day PFT data, then the grazed area is
limited to the larger of the potential or current day vegetated area.
This is done to prevent representing sparsely vegetated grazing areas as
100% vegetated pastures. Once the grazing area is less than or equal to
the total vegetated area, then grazing areas are assigned to the C3 and
C4 grass areas based on their potential vegetation and current day
fractions. In areas where the grazing area cannot be met through the
current day or potential vegetation grass fraction alone, the current
day tree PFTs are converted to grass PFTs, with the remaining shrub PFTs
included as being grazed.</p>
<p>Once crop and pasture areas are assigned to a grid cell, the remaining
area is assigned to primary and secondary natural vegetation. Primary
vegetation is assumed to be undisturbed and reflects the potential
vegetation PFT distributions. In the secondary region, the PFT
distributions are based on the current day non-crop and non-pasture PFTs
in the grid cell. This process ensures that the PFT distributions are
kept consistent with the original current day and potential vegetation
CLM parameters, while remaining faithful to the stocktickerUNH assigned
areas.</p>

<h3>21.3.6. Forest Harvest Dataset Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#forest-harvest-dataset-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Discussions following the initial analysis of CCSM4 land cover change
experiments found there were very high wood harvest areas compared to
wood harvest carbon in the RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 time series. The high
wood harvest areas were traced to using gridded spatially explicit wood
harvest targets from the MESSAGE and AIM groups for these two time
series, rather than using regional targets with spatial downscaling in
GLM as done with the other three time periods. As a result of these
discussions new amended wood harvest targets were generated with
regional targets through GLM for the RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 time series as
described in Lawrence et al. (2012).</p>

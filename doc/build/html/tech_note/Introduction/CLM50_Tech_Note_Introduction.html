<p>The purpose of this document is to fully describe the biogeophysical and
biogeochemical parameterizations and numerical implementation of version
5.0 of the Community Land Model (CLM5.0). Scientific justification and
evaluation of these parameterizations can be found in the referenced
scientific papers (<span class="xref std std-ref">rst_References</span>). This document and the CLM5.0
User’s Guide together provide the user with the scientific description
and operating instructions for CLM.</p>

<h3>2.1.1.1. Inception of CLM<a class="headerlink" href="#inception-of-clm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The early development of the Community Land Model can be described as
the merging of a community-developed land model focusing on
biogeophysics and a concurrent effort at NCAR to expand the NCAR Land
Surface Model (NCAR LSM, <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#bonan1996"><span class="std std-ref">Bonan 1996</span></a>) to include the carbon cycle,
vegetation dynamics, and river routing. The concept of a
community-developed land component of the Community Climate System Model
(CCSM) was initially proposed at the CCSM Land Model Working Group
(LMWG) meeting in February 1996. Initial software specifications and
development focused on evaluating the best features of three existing
land models: the NCAR LSM (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#bonan1996"><span class="std std-ref">Bonan 1996, 1998</span></a>) used in the Community
Climate Model (CCM3) and the initial version of CCSM; the Institute of
Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences land model (IAP94) (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#daizeng1997"><span class="std std-ref">Dai
and Zeng 1997</span></a>); and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS)
(<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#dickinsonetal1993"><span class="std std-ref">Dickinson et al. 1993</span></a>) used with CCM2. A scientific steering committee
was formed to review the initial specifications of the design provided
by Robert Dickinson, Gordon Bonan, Xubin Zeng, and Yongjiu Dai and to
facilitate further development. Steering committee members were selected
so as to provide guidance and expertise in disciplines not generally
well-represented in land surface models (e.g., carbon cycling,
ecological modeling, hydrology, and river routing) and included
scientists from NCAR, the university community, and government
laboratories (R. Dickinson, G. Bonan, X. Zeng, Paul Dirmeyer, Jay
Famiglietti, Jon Foley, and Paul Houser).</p>
<p>The specifications for the new model, designated the Common Land Model,
were discussed and agreed upon at the June 1998 CCSM Workshop LMWG
meeting. An initial code was developed by Y. Dai and was examined in
March 1999 by Mike Bosilovich, P. Dirmeyer, and P. Houser. At this point
an extensive period of code testing was initiated. Keith Oleson, Y. Dai,
Adam Schlosser, and P. Houser presented preliminary results of offline
1-dimensional testing at the June 1999 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting.

preliminary coupling of the Common Land Model to CCM3, indicating that
the land model could be successfully coupled to a climate model.</p>
<p>Results of coupled simulations using CCM3 and the Common Land Model were
presented by X. Zeng at the June 2000 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting.
Comparisons with the NCAR LSM and observations indicated major
improvements to the seasonality of runoff, substantial reduction of a
summer cold bias, and snow depth. Some deficiencies related to runoff
and albedo were noted, however, that were subsequently addressed. Z.-L.
Yang and I. Baker demonstrated improvements in the simulation of snow
and soil temperatures. Sam Levis reported on efforts to incorporate a
river routing model to deliver runoff to the ocean model in CCSM. Soon
after the workshop, the code was delivered to NCAR for implementation
into the CCSM framework. Documentation for the Common Land Model is

<h3>2.1.1.2. CLM2<a class="headerlink" href="#clm2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Concurrent with the development of the Common Land Model, the NCAR LSM
was undergoing further development at NCAR in the areas of carbon
cycling, vegetation dynamics, and river routing. The preservation of
these advancements necessitated several modifications to the Common Land
Model. The biome-type land cover classification scheme was replaced with
a plant functional type (PFT) representation with the specification of
PFTs and leaf area index from satellite data (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#olesonbonan2000"><span class="std std-ref">Oleson and Bonan 2000</span></a>;
<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#bonanetal2002a"><span class="std std-ref">Bonan et al. 2002a, b</span></a>). This also required modifications to
parameterizations for vegetation albedo and vertical burying of
vegetation by snow. Changes were made to canopy scaling, leaf
physiology, and soil water limitations on photosynthesis to resolve
deficiencies indicated by the coupling to a dynamic vegetation model.
Vertical heterogeneity in soil texture was implemented to improve
coupling with a dust emission model. A river routing model was
incorporated to improve the fresh water balance over oceans. Numerous
modest changes were made to the parameterizations to conform to the
strict energy and water balance requirements of CCSM. Further
substantial software development was also required to meet coding
standards. The resulting model was adopted in May 2002 as the Community
Land Model (CLM2) for use with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM2, the
successor to CCM3) and version 2 of the Community Climate System Model
(CCSM2).</p>
<p>K. Oleson reported on initial results from a coupling of CCM3 with CLM2
at the June 2001 CCSM Workshop LMWG meeting. Generally, the CLM2
preserved most of the improvements seen in the Common Land Model,
particularly with respect to surface air temperature, runoff, and snow.
These simulations are documented in <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#bonanetal2002a"><span class="std std-ref">Bonan et al. (2002a)</span></a>. Further small
improvements to the biogeophysical parameterizations, ongoing software
development, and extensive analysis and validation within CAM2 and CCSM2
culminated in the release of CLM2 to the community in May 2002.</p>
<p>Following this release, Peter Thornton implemented changes to the model
structure required to represent carbon and nitrogen cycling in the
model. This involved changing data structures from a single vector of
spatially independent sub-grid patches to one that recognizes three
hierarchical scales within a model grid cell: land unit, snow/soil
column, and PFT. Furthermore, as an option, the model can be configured
so that PFTs can share a single soil column and thus “compete” for
water. This version of the model (CLM2.1) was released to the community
in February 2003. CLM2.1, without the compete option turned on, produced
only round off level changes when compared to CLM2.</p>

<div class="section" id="clm3">
<h3>2.1.1.3. CLM3<a class="headerlink" href="#clm3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CLM3 implemented further software improvements related to performance
and model output, a re-writing of the code to support vector-based
computational platforms, and improvements in biogeophysical
parameterizations to correct deficiencies in the coupled model climate.
Of these parameterization improvements, two were shown to have a
noticeable impact on simulated climate. A variable aerodynamic
resistance for heat/moisture transfer from ground to canopy air that
depends on canopy density was implemented. This reduced unrealistically
high surface temperatures in semi-arid regions. The second improvement
added stability corrections to the diagnostic 2-m air temperature
calculation which reduced biases in this temperature. Competition
between PFTs for water, in which PFTs share a single soil column, is the
default mode of operation in this model version. CLM3 was released to
the community in June 2004. <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#dickinsonetal2006"><span class="std std-ref">Dickinson et al. (2006)</span></a>

<h3>2.1.1.4. CLM3.5<a class="headerlink" href="#clm3-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although the simulation of land surface climate by CLM3 was in many ways
adequate, most of the unsatisfactory aspects of the simulated climate
noted by the above studies could be traced directly to deficiencies in
simulation of the hydrological cycle. In 2004, a project was initiated
to improve the hydrology in CLM3 as part of the development of CLM
version 3.5. A selected set of promising approaches to alleviating the
hydrologic biases in CLM3 were tested and implemented. These included
new surface datasets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, new parameterizations for canopy
integration, canopy interception, frozen soil, soil water availability,
and soil evaporation, a TOPMODEL-based model for surface and subsurface
runoff, a groundwater model for determining water table depth, and the
introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen limitation on plant
productivity. <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#olesonetal2008a"><span class="std std-ref">Oleson et al. (2008a)</span></a> show that CLM3.5 exhibits
significant improvements over CLM3 in its partitioning of global ET
which result in wetter soils, less plant water stress, increased
transpiration and photosynthesis, and an improved annual cycle of total
water storage. Phase and amplitude of the runoff annual cycle is
generally improved. Dramatic improvements in vegetation biogeography
result when CLM3.5 is coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model.

<h3>2.1.1.5. CLM4<a class="headerlink" href="#clm4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The motivation for the next version of the model, CLM4, was to
incorporate several recent scientific advances in the understanding and
representation of land surface processes, expand model capabilities, and
improve surface and atmospheric forcing datasets (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#lawrenceetal2011"><span class="std std-ref">Lawrence et al. 2011</span></a>).
Included in the first category are more sophisticated representations of
soil hydrology and snow processes. In particular, new treatments of soil
column-groundwater interactions, soil evaporation, aerodynamic
parameters for sparse/dense canopies, vertical burial of vegetation by
snow, snow cover fraction and aging, black carbon and dust deposition,
and vertical distribution of solar energy for snow were implemented.
Major new capabilities in the model include a representation of the
carbon-nitrogen cycle (CLM4CN, see next paragraph for additional
information), the ability to model land cover change in a transient
mode, inclusion of organic soil and deep soil into the existing mineral
soil treatment to enable more realistic modeling of permafrost, an urban
canyon model to contrast rural and urban energy balance and climate
(CLMU), and an updated biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) model.
Other modifications of note include refinement of the global PFT,
wetland, and lake distributions, more realistic optical properties for
grasslands and croplands, and an improved diurnal cycle and spectral
distribution of incoming solar radiation to force the model in land-only
mode.</p>
<p>Many of the ideas incorporated into the carbon and nitrogen cycle
component of CLM4 derive from the earlier development of the land-only
ecosystem process model Biome-BGC (Biome BioGeochemical Cycles),
originating at the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) at the
University of Montana, under the guidance of Prof. Steven Running.
Biome-BGC itself is an extension of an earlier model, Forest-BGC
(<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#runningcoughlan1988"><span class="std std-ref">Running and Coughlan, 1988</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#runninggower1991"><span class="std std-ref">Running and Gower, 1991</span></a>), which
simulates water, carbon, and, to a limited extent, nitrogen fluxes for
forest ecosystems. Forest-BGC was designed to be driven by remote
sensing inputs of vegetation structure, and so used a diagnostic
(prescribed) leaf area index, or, in the case of the dynamic allocation
version of the model (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#runninggower1991"><span class="std std-ref">Running and Gower, 1991</span></a>), prescribed maximum
leaf area index.</p>
<p>Biome-BGC expanded on the Forest-BGC logic by introducing a more
mechanistic calculation of leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#huntrunning1992"><span class="std std-ref">Hunt

more mechanistic descriptions of belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles,
nitrogen controls on photosynthesis and decomposition, sunlit and shaded
canopies, vertical gradient in leaf morphology, and explicit treatment
of fire and harvest disturbance and regrowth dynamics (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#kimballetal1997"><span class="std std-ref">Kimball et al.

departure for integrating new biogeochemistry components into CLM4.</p>
<p>CLM4 was released to the community in June, 2010 along with the
Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). CLM4 is used in CCSM4,

<h3>2.1.1.6. CLM4.5<a class="headerlink" href="#clm4-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The motivations for the development of CLM4.5 were similar to those for CLM4:
incorporate several recent scientific advances in the understanding and
representation of land surface processes, expand model capabilities, and
improve surface and atmospheric forcing datasets.</p>
<p>Specifically, several parameterizations were revised to reflect new
scientific understanding and in an attempt to reduce biases identified
in CLM4 simulations including low soil carbon stocks especially in the
Arctic, excessive tropical GPP and unrealistically low Arctic GPP, a dry
soil bias in Arctic soils, unrealistically high LAI in the tropics, a
transient 20<img class="math" src="../../_images/math/99dc7dfb3073bface29bdc5259fc663a005c9c02.svg" alt="{}^{th}"/> century carbon response that was
inconsistent with observational estimates, and several other more minor
problems or biases.</p>
<p>The main modifications include updates to canopy processes including a
revised canopy radiation scheme and canopy scaling of leaf processes,
co-limitations on photosynthesis, revisions to photosynthetic parameters
(<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#bonanetal2011"><span class="std std-ref">Bonan et al. 2011</span></a>), temperature acclimation of photosynthesis, and

stomatal conductance model (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#sunetal2012"><span class="std std-ref">Sun et al. 2012</span></a>). Hydrology updates included
modifications such that hydraulic properties of frozen soils are
determined by liquid water content only rather than total water content
and the introduction of an ice impedance function, and other corrections
that increase the consistency between soil water state and water table
position and allow for a perched water table above icy permafrost ground
(<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#swensonetal2012"><span class="std std-ref">Swenson et al. 2012</span></a>). A new snow cover fraction parameterization is

revised and more realistic lake model (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#subinetal2012a"><span class="std std-ref">Subin et al. 2012a</span></a>). A surface
water store was introduced, replacing the wetland land unit and
permitting prognostic wetland distribution modeling. The surface
energy fluxes are calculated separately (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#swensonlawrence2012"><span class="std std-ref">Swenson and Lawrence, 2012</span></a>) for
snow-covered, water-covered, and snow/water-free portions of vegetated
and crop land units, and snow-covered and snow-free portions of glacier
land units. Globally constant river flow velocity is replaced with
variable flow velocity based on mean grid cell slope. A vertically
resolved soil biogeochemistry scheme is introduced with base
decomposition rates modified by soil temperature, water, and oxygen
limitations and also including vertical mixing of soil carbon and
nitrogen due to bioturbation, cryoturbation, and diffusion (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#kovenetal2013"><span class="std std-ref">Koven et al.

realistically over the year (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#kovenetal2013"><span class="std std-ref">Koven et al. 2013</span></a>). The fire model was

shrub phenology from stress deciduous to seasonal deciduous and a change
in the glacier bare ice albedo to better reflect recent estimates.
Finally, the carbon and nitrogen cycle spinup is accelerated and
streamlined with a revised spinup method, though the spinup timescale
remains long.</p>
<p>Finally, the predominantly low resolution input data for provided with

<div class="section" id="clm5-0">
<h3>2.1.1.7. CLM5.0<a class="headerlink" href="#clm5-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5.  Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling,
and crop modeling.
Much of the focus of development centered on a
push towards more mechanistic treatment of key processes, in addition to more comprehensive and explicit representation
of land use and land-cover change. Prior versions of CLM included relatively few options for physics parameterizations or structure.
In CLM5, where new parameterizations or model decisions were made, in most cases, the CLM4.5 parameterization was maintained so that users could switch back and forth between different parameterizations via namelist control where appropriate or desirable.  Throughout the CLM5 Technical Descpription, in general only the default parameterization for any given process is described.  Readers are referred to the CLM4.5 or CLM4 Technical Descriptions for detailed descriptions of non-default parameterizations.</p>
<p>The hydrology updates include the introduction of a dry surface layer-based soil evaporation resistance parameterization <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#swensonlawrence2014"><span class="std std-ref">(Swenson and Lawrence, 2014)</span></a> and a revised canopy interception parameterization.  Canopy interception is now divided into liquid and solid phases, with the intercepted snow subject to unloading events due to wind or above-freezing temperatures.  The snow-covered fraction of the canopy is used within the canopy radiation and surface albedo calculation.  Instead of applying a spatially uniform soil thickness, soil thickness can vary in space <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#brunkeetal2016"><span class="std std-ref">(Brunke et al. 2016</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#swensonlawrence2015"><span class="std std-ref">Swenson and Lawrence, 2015)</span></a> and is set to values within a range of 0.4m to 8.5m depth, derived from a spatially explicit soil thickness data product <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#pelletieretal2016"><span class="std std-ref">(Pelletier et al., 2016)</span></a>.  The explicit treatment of soil thickness allows for the deprecation of the unconfined aquifer parameterization used in CLM4.5, which is replaced with a zero flux boundary condition and explicit modeling of both the saturated and unsaturated zones.  The default model soil layer resolution is increased, especially within the top 3m, to more explicitly represent active layer thickness within the permafrost zone.  Rooting profiles were used inconsistently in CLM4.5 with <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#zeng2001"><span class="std std-ref">Zeng (2001)</span></a> profiles used for water and <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#jacksonetal1996"><span class="std std-ref">Jackson et al. (1996)</span></a> profiles used for carbon inputs.  For CLM5, the Jackson et al. (1996) rooting profiles are used for both water and carbon.  Roots are deepened for the broadleaf evergreen tropical tree and broadleaf deciduous tropical tree types.  Finally, an adaptive time-stepping solution to the Richard’s equation is introduced, which improves the accuracy and stability of the numerical soil water solution.  The River Transport Model (RTM) is replaced with the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART, <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#lietal2013b"><span class="std std-ref">Li et al., 2013b)</span></a> in which surface runoff is routed across hillslopes and then discharged along with subsurface runoff into a tributary subnetwork before entering the main channel.</p>
<p>Several changes are included that are mainly targeted at improving the simulation of surface mass balance over ice
sheets.  The fresh snow density parameterization is updated to more realistically capture temperature effects and to additionally account for wind effects on new snow density <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#vankampenhoutetal2017"><span class="std std-ref">(van Kampenhout et al., 2017)</span></a>.

The CISM2 ice sheet model is included for Greenland by default.  The ice sheet does not evolve for typical configurations, but ice sheet evolution can be turned on by choosing an appropriate compset.  The introduction in CLM5 of the capability to
dynamically adjust landunit weights means that a glacier can initiate, grow, shrink, or disappear during
a simulation when ice evolution is active.  That is, there are two-way feedbacks between CLM and CISM.  Multiple elevation classes (10 elevation classes by default) and associated temperature, rain/snow partitioning, and downwelling longwave downscaling are used for glacier landunits to account for the strong topographic elevation heterogeneity over glaciers and ice sheets.</p>
<p>A plant hydraulic stress routine is introduced which explicitly models water transport through the vegetation according to a simple hydraulic framework (Kennedy et al., to be submitted).  The water supply equations are used to solve for vegetation water potential forced by transpiration demand and a set of layer-by-layer soil water potentials.  Stomatal conductance, therefore, is a function of prognostic leaf water potential.  Water stress is calculated as the ratio of attenuated stomatal conductance to maximum stomatal conductance.  An emergent feature of the plant hydraulics is soil hydraulic redistribution.  In CLM5, maximum stomatal conductance is obtained from the Medlyn conductance model <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#medlynetal2011"><span class="std std-ref">(Medlyn et al., 2011)</span></a>, rather than the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance model that was utilized in CLM4.5 and prior versions of the model. The Medlyn stomatal conductance model is preferred mainly for it’s more realistic behavior at low humidity levels <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#rogersetal2017"><span class="std std-ref">(Rogers et al., 2017)</span></a>. The stress deciduous vegetation phenology trigger is augmented with a antecedent precipitation requirement <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#dahlinetal2015"><span class="std std-ref">(Dahlin et al. 2015)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Plant nutrient dynamics are substantially updated to resolve several deficiencies with the CLM4 and CLM4.5 nutrient cycling representation.  The Fixation and Update of Nitrogen (FUN) model based on the work of <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#fisheretal2010"><span class="std std-ref">Fisher et al. (2010)</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#brzosteketal2014"><span class="std std-ref">Brzostek et al. (2014)</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#shietal2016"><span class="std std-ref">Shi et al. (2016)</span></a> is incorporated.  The concept of FUN is that in most cases, N uptake requires the expenditure of energy in the form of carbon, and further, that there are numerous potential sources of N in the environment which a plant may exchange for carbon. The ratio of carbon expended to N acquired is therefore the cost, or exchange rate, of N acquisition.  FUN calculates the rate of symbiotic N fixation, with this N passed straight to the plant, not the mineral N pool.  Separately, CLM5 also calculates rates of symbiotic (or free living) N fixation as a function of evapotranspiration (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#clevelandetal1999"><span class="std std-ref">Cleveland et al. 1999</span></a>), which
is added to the soil inorganic ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) pool.  The static plant carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios utilized in CLM4 and CLM4.5 are replaced with variable plant C:N ratios which
allows plants to adjust their C:N ratio, and therefore their leaf nitrogen content, with the cost of N uptake <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#ghimireetal2016"><span class="std std-ref">(Ghimire et al. 2016)</span></a>.
The implementation of a flexible C:N ratio means that the model no longer relies on instantaneous downregulation
of potential photosynthesis rates based on soil mineral nitrogen availability to represent nutrient limitation.  Furthermore, stomatal conductance
is now based on the N-limited photosynthesis rather than on potential photosynthesis. Finally, the Leaf Use of
Nitrogen for Assimilation (LUNA, <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#xuetal2012"><span class="std std-ref">Xu et al., 2012</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#alietal2016"><span class="std std-ref">Ali et al., 2016)</span></a> model is incorporated.  The LUNA model calculates
photosynthetic capacity based on optimization of the use of leaf nitrogen under different environmental conditions such that
light capture, carboxylation, and respiration are co-limiting.</p>
<p>CLM5 applies a fixed allocation scheme for woody vegetation.  The decision to use a fixed allocation scheme in CLM5, rather than a dynamic NPP-based allocation scheme, as was used in CLM4 and CLM4.5, was driven by the fact that observations indicate that biomass saturates with increasing productivity, in contrast to the behavior in CLM4 and CLM4.5 where biomass continuously increases with increasing productivity (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#negronjuarezetal2015"><span class="std std-ref">Negron-Juarez et al., 2015</span></a>).  Soil carbon decomposition processes are unchanged in CLM5, but a new metric for apparent soil carbon turnover times (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#kovenetal2017"><span class="std std-ref">Koven et al., 2017</span></a>) suggested parameter changes that produce a weak intrinsic depth limitation on soil carbon turnover rates (rather than the strong depth limitaiton in CLM4.5) and that the thresholds for soil moisture limitation on soil carbon turnover rates in dry soils should be set at a wetter soil moisture level than that used in CLM4.5.</p>
<p>Representation of human management of the land (agriculture, wood harvest) is augmented in several ways. The CLM4.5 crop model is extended to operate globally through the addition of rice and sugarcane as well as tropical varieties of corn and soybean <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#badgeranddirmeyer2015"><span class="std std-ref">(Badger and Dirmeyer, 2015</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#levisetal2016"><span class="std std-ref">Levis et al., 2016)</span></a>.  These crop types are added to the existing temperate corn, temperature soybean, spring wheat, and cotton crop types.
Fertilization rates and irrigation equipped area updated annually based on crop type and geographic region through an input dataset.  The irrigation trigger is updated.  Additional minor changes include crop phenological triggers that
vary by latitude for selected crop types, grain C and N is now removed at harvest to a 1-year product pool with
the carbon for the next season’s crop seed removed from the grain carbon at harvest.  Through the introduction of
the capability to dynamically adjust landunit weights during a simulation, the crop model can now be run coincidentally
with prescribed land use, which significantly expands the capabilities of the model.  Mass-based rather than area-based wood harvest is applied. Several heat stress indices for both urban and rural areas are calculated and output by default <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#buzanetal2015"><span class="std std-ref">(Buzan et al., 2015)</span></a>.   A more sophisticated and realistic building space heating and air conditioning submodel that prognoses interior building air temperature and includes more realistic space heating and air conditioning wasteheat factors
is incorporated.</p>
<p>The fire model is the same as utilized in CLM4.5 except that a modified scheme is used to estimate the dependence of fire occurrence and spread on fuel wetness for non-peat fires outside cropland and tropical closed forests <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#lilawrence2017"><span class="std std-ref">(Li and Lawrence, 2017)</span></a> and the dependence of agricultural fires on fuel load is removed.</p>
<p>Included with the release of CLM5.0 is a functionally supported version of the Functionally-Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES, <a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#fisheretal2015"><span class="std std-ref">Fisher et al., 2015)</span></a>. A major motivation of FATES is to allow the prediction of biome boundaries directly from plant physiological traits via their competitive interactions.  FATES is a cohort model of vegetation competition and co-existence, allowing a representation of the biosphere which accounts for the division of the land surface into successional stages, and for competition for light between height structured cohorts of representative trees of various plant functional types.  FATES is not active by default in CLM5.0.</p>
<p>Note that the classical dynamic global vegetation model (CLM-DGVM) that has been available within CLM4 and CLM4.5 remains available, though it is largely untested.  The technical description of the CLM-DGVM can be found within the CLM4.5 Technical Description (<a class="reference internal" href="../References/CLM50_Tech_Note_References.html#olesonetal2013"><span class="std std-ref">Oleson et al. 2013)</span></a>.</p>
<p>During the course of the development of CLM5.0, it became clear that the increasing complexity of the model combined with the increasing number and range
of model development projects required updates to the underlying CLM infrastructure.  Many such software improvements
are included in CLM5 including a partial transition to an object-oriented modular software structure. Many hard coded model
parameters have been extracted into either the parameter file or the CLM namelist, which allows users to more readily calibrate the model for use at
specific locations or to conduct parameter sensitivity studies.  As part of the effort to increase
the scientific utility of the code, in most instances older generation parameterizations (i.e., the parameterizations
available in CLM4 or CLM4.5) are retained under namelist switches, allowing the user to revert to CLM4.5
from the same code base or to revert individual parameterizations where the old parameterizations are compatible with the new code.  Finally, multiple vertical soil layer structures
are defined and it is relatively easy to add additional structures.</p>

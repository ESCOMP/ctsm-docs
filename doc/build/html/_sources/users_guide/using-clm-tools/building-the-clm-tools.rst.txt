========================
 Building the CLM tools
========================

The FORTRAN tools all have similar makefiles, and similar options for building. 
All of the Makefiles use GNU Make extensions and thus require that you use GNU make to use them. 
They also auto detect the type of platform you are on, using "uname -s" and set the compiler, compiler flags and such accordingly. 
There are also environment variables that can be set to set things that must be customized. 
All the tools use NetCDF and hence require the path to the NetCDF libraries and include files. 
On some platforms (such as Linux) multiple compilers can be used, and hence there are env variables that can be set to change the FORTRAN and/or "C" compilers used. 
The tools other than cprnc also allow finer control, by also allowing the user to add compiler flags they choose, for both FORTRAN and "C", as well as picking the compiler, linker and and add linker options. 
Finally the tools other than **cprnc** allow you to turn optimization on (which is off by default but on for the **mksurfdata_map** and **interpinic** programs) with the OPT flag so that the tool will run faster. 
To get even faster performance, the **interpinic**, program allows you to also use the SMP to turn on multiple shared memory processors. 
When ``SMP=TRUE`` you set the number of threads used by the program with the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` environment variable.

Options used by all: **cprnc**, **interpinic**, and **mksurfdata_map**

- ``LIB_NETCDF`` -- sets the location of the NetCDF library.
- ``INC_NETCDF`` -- sets the location of the NetCDF include files.
- ``USER_FC`` -- sets the name of the FORTRAN compiler.

Options used by: **interpinic**, **mkprocdata_map**, **mkmapgrids**, and **mksurfdata_map**

- ``MOD_NETCDF`` -- sets the location of the NetCDF FORTRAN module.
- ``USER_LINKER`` -- sets the name of the linker to use.
- ``USER_CPPDEFS`` -- adds any CPP defines to use.
- ``USER_CFLAGS`` -- add any "C" compiler flags to use.
- ``USER_FFLAGS`` -- add any FORTRAN compiler flags to use.
- ``USER_LDFLAGS`` -- add any linker flags to use.
- ``USER_CC`` -- sets the name of the "C" compiler to use.
- ``OPT`` -- set to TRUE to compile the code optimized (TRUE or FALSE)
- ``SMP`` -- set to TRUE to turn on shared memory parallelism (i.e. OpenMP) (TRUE or FALSE)
- ``Filepath`` -- list of directories to build source code from.
- ``Srcfiles`` -- list of source code filenames to build executable from.
- ``Makefile`` -- customized makefile options for this particular tool.
- ``mkDepends`` -- figure out dependencies between source files, so make can compile in order..
- ``Makefile.common`` -- General tool Makefile that should be the same between all tools.

Options used only by **cprnc**:

- ``EXEDIR`` -- sets the location where the executable will be built.
- ``VPATH`` -- colon delimited path list to find the source files.

More details on each environment variable.

``LIB_NETCDF``
  This variable sets the path to the NetCDF library file (``libnetcdf.a``). If not set it defaults to ``/usr/local/lib``. In order to use the tools you need to build the NetCDF library and be able to link to it. In order to build the model with a particular compiler you may have to compile the NetCDF library with the same compiler (or at least a compatible one).

``INC_NETCDF``
  This variable sets the path to the NetCDF include directory (in order to find the include file ``netcdf.inc``). if not set it defaults to ``/usr/local/include``.

``MOD_NETCDF``
  This variable sets the path to the NetCDF module directory (in order to find the NetCDF FORTRAN-90 module file when NetCDF is used with a FORTRAN-90 **use statement**. When not set it defaults to the ``LIB_NETCDF`` value.

``USER_FC``
  This variable sets the command name to the FORTRAN-90 compiler to use when compiling the tool. The default compiler to use depends on the platform. And for example, on the AIX platform this variable is NOT used

``USER_LINKER``
  This variable sets the command name to the linker to use when linking the object files from the compiler together to build the executable. By default this is set to the value of the FORTRAN-90 compiler used to compile the source code.

``USER_CPPDEFS``
  This variable adds additional optional values to define for the C preprocessor. Normally, there is no reason to do this as there are very few CPP tokens in the CLM tools. However, if you modify the tools there may be a reason to define new CPP tokens.

``USER_CC``
  This variable sets the command name to the "C" compiler to use when compiling the tool. The default compiler to use depends on the platform. And for example, on the AIX platform this variable is NOT used

``USER_CFLAGS``
  This variable adds additional compiler options for the "C" compiler to use when compiling the tool. By default the compiler options are picked according to the platform and compiler that will be used.

``USER_FFLAGS``
  This variable adds additional compiler options for the FORTRAN-90 compiler to use when compiling the tool. By default the compiler options are picked according to the platform and compiler that will be used.

``USER_LDFLAGS``
  This variable adds additional options to the linker that will be used when linking the object files into the executable. By default the linker options are picked according to the platform and compiler that is used.

``SMP``
  This variable flags if shared memory parallelism (using OpenMP) should be used when compiling the tool. It can be set to either TRUE or FALSE, by default it is set to FALSE, so shared memory parallelism is NOT used. When set to TRUE you can set the number of threads by using the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable. Normally, the most you would set this to would be to the number of on-node CPU processors. Turning this on should make the tool run much faster.

.. warning:: Note, that depending on the compiler answers may be different when SMP is activated.

``OPT``
  This variable flags if compiler optimization should be used when compiling the tool. It can be set to either ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``, by default it is set to ``FALSE`` for **mkmapgrids** and ``TRUE`` for **mksurfdata_map**, **mkprocdata_map** and **interpinic**. Turning this on should make the tool run much faster.

.. warning:: Note, you should expect that answers will be different when ``OPT`` is activated.

``Filepath``
  All of the tools are stand-alone and don't need any outside code to operate. The Filepath is the list of directories needed to compile and hence is always simply "." the current directory. Several tools use copies of code outside their directory that is in the CESM distribution (either ``csm_share`` code or CLM source code).

``Srcfiles``
  The ``Srcfiles`` lists the filenames of the source code to use when building the tool.

``Makefile``
  The ``Makefile`` is the custom GNU Makefile for this particular tool. It will customize the ``EXENAME`` and the optimization settings for this particular tool.

``Makefile.common``
  The ``Makefile.common`` is the copy of the general GNU Makefile for all the CLM tools. This file should be identical between the different tools. This file has different sections of compiler options for different Operating Systems and compilers.

``mkDepends``
  The ``mkDepends`` is the copy of the perl script used by the ``Makefile.common`` to figure out the dependencies between the source files so that it can compile in the necessary order. This file should be identical between the different tools.

``EXEDIR``
  The cprnc tool uses this variable to set the location of where the executable will be built. The default is the current directory.

``VPATH``
  The **cprnc** tool uses this variable to set the colon delimited pathnames of where the source code exists. The default is the current directory.

.. note:: There are several files that are copies of the original files from either models``/lnd/clm/src/util_share``, ``models/csm_share/shr``, or copies from other tool directories. By having copies the tools can all be made stand-alone, but any changes to the originals will have to be put into the tool directories as well.

The *README.filecopies* (which can be found in ``models/lnd/clm/tools``) is repeated here.

      models/lnd/clm/tools/README.filecopies			      Jun/04/2013

   There are several files that are copies of the original files from
   either models/lnd/clm/src/main, models/csm_share/shr,
   models/csm_share/unit_testers, or copies from other tool
   directories. By having copies the tools can all be made stand-alone,
   but any changes to the originals will have to be put into the tool
   directories as well.

   I. Files that are IDENTICAL:

      1. csm_share files copied that should be identical to models/csm_share/shr:

	  shr_const_mod.F90
	  shr_log_mod.F90
	  shr_timer_mod.F90

      2. csm_share files copied that should be identical to models/csm_share/unit_testers:

	  test_mod.F90

      3. clm/src files copied that should be identical to models/lnd/clm/src/util_share:

	  nanMod.F90

   II. Files with differences

      1. csm_share files copied with differences:

	  shr_kind_mod.F90 --- SHR_KIND_CXX is new
	  shr_sys_mod.F90 ---- Remove mpi abort and reference to shr_mpi_mod.F90.
	  shr_infnan_mod.F90 - Earlier version
	  shr_string_mod.F90 - Earlier version
	  shr_file_mod.F90 --- mkprocdata_map version is stripped down
	  clm_varctl.F90 ----- Earlier version

      2. clm/src files with differences:

	  fileutils.F90 --- Remove use of masterproc and spmdMod and endrun in abortutils.

      4. Files in mkmapgrids

	 domainMod.F90 ---- Highly customized based off an earlier version of clm code.
			    Remove use of abortutils, spmdMod. clm version uses latlon
			    this version uses domain in names. Distributed memory
			    parallelism is removed.

      5. Files in mksurfdata_map

	  mkvarpar.F90 --- clm4_0 and clm4_5 versions are different and different from main clm versions.
